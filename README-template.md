## My process
- I started with the HTML.
- in the body, I created a container to hold everything involving content, for the web page.
- I created an article element to hold the Qr card elements
- not sure why I used figcaption I just think I am supposed to.
- CSS I started with trying to size everything appropriately.
- then using flexbox I positioned the element's center.
- adjusted color size, margin, and padding of the elements to match the example.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (I think...)

### What I learned

I'm not sure what to say, but I guess this helped me understand, pixels, and viewport measurement units. I was confused because I was told viewport measurement units are better, but I think it has its own use case. It wasn't working well in this project. Please tell me where viewport measurement units would be used.


### Continued development

 I would like to get more familiar with sizing. in the style guide, there were sizes for mobile and desktop. I am not sure where to incorporate the changes to accommodate both sizes. do I change the width and height of everything? do I only add a @media selector to change the size? when I start do I use the * selector and set width and height to the size of the desktop or mobile?
